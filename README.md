Additional files for GEOS2916.

Me like pretty plots in R Studio.

Currently have files for:
1. Denudation report

denudation.qmd - R code for plotting isotope ratios in ggplot2. Additional plot extensions include ggpmisc for adding the R^2 value to a plot.

river.xlsx - calculations for the river cross-section activity and mean width estimates for Oxbow and Murrumbidgee River.

3. Thermochronology report
TBA.

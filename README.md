Me like pretty plots in R Studio.

1. Denudation report

denudation.qmd - R code for plotting isotope ratios in ggplot2. Additional plot extensions include ggpmisc for adding the R^2 value to a plot.

river.xlsx - calculations for the river cross-section activity and mean width estimates for Oxbow and Murrumbidgee River.

2. Thermochronology report

thermochron.xlsx - calculations for denudation rates.

3. Landscape report

aridland.qmd - R code for plotting Tortoise Lagoon and Vostok dust fluxes.

glacier.qmd - R code for plotting glacial moraine length at Blue Lake and temperature changes over the late Pleistocene.

4. Hydrology report

streampower.qmd - calculations for monthly stream power and specific stream power.
